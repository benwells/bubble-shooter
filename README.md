# Bubble Shooter!!

## What the heck is this project?

The goal of this project was to focus on object-oriented JavaScript by building
a crude, never-ending canvas shooter game.  I wanted to keep the libraries utilized to
a minimum so that I could concentrate on plain JavaScript.  I did utilized
the following:

  - jQuery
  - jQuery hotkeys - for keybindings
  - Bootstrap - for the layout

## How do I play?

- `git clone` the repository
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm start` to run local server and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to play!

## What's next for this project

 - A better scrolling background
 - Enemy Bubbles that shoot back
 - Boss Fights!!
